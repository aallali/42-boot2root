## UnSquashfs / Squashfs
since we have an image of that boot2root system which is in the ISO given 
- we will extract the `filesystem.squashfs` with the premission attached.
- and then either decrypt the passwords there (like snowcrash) or dig into what's left by the sysadmin, and many other ways.
- for our situation, we read the `.bash_history` and found the password of 
user `zaz` (from what the root user were typing when costumizing the image)

#### steps : 
- mount the iso image and go to the mount folder.

    ![iso mount](../img/isomounted.png)
- open the casper file, you will find something there (hhhhh of course u will find something).
    ![casper folder](../img/casper_folder.png)
- copy the `filesystem.squashfs` file outside the mount folder because we cant operate there due to permissions `mkdir ~/Desktop/tmp && cp filesystem.squashfs ~/Desktop/tmp && cd ~/Desktop/tmp`.
- execute the following command **`sudo unsquashfs -f -max 4 filesystem.squashfs`**.
    ![unsquachs](../img/unsquach.png)
- notice that we got a new fodler called `squashfs-root`.
- chmod it as well as the `root` folder to get permission to list items inside.
    ![beforerootfolder](../img/beforerootfolder.png)
- go inside the root folder.

    ![rootfolder](../img/rootfolder.png)
- read the `.bash_history` file that contains the history of commands executed on the shell, after some time of searching we notice an `adduser` command with the name `zaz` and the password `646da671ca01bb5d84dbb5fb2238dc8e`
    ![bashHistory](../img/bashHistory.png)

- well we got the user zaz
    ```txt
    zaz
    646da671ca01bb5d84dbb5fb2238dc8e
    ```
- log with it, we get into the user zaz shell, an `exploit_me` executable is there, you can exploit it and congrats you get the root shell.
